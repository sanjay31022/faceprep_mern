    <p style="color:blue";>Baby, I like your style
        Grips on your waist
        Front way, back way
        You know that I don't play
        Streets not safe
        But I never run away
        Even when I'm away
        OT, OT, there's never much love when we go OT
        I pray to make it back in one piece
        I pray, I pray
        That's why I need a one dance
        Got a Hennessy in my hand
        One more time 'fore I go
        Higher powers taking a hold on me
        I need a one dance
        Got a Hennessy in my hand
        One more time 'fore I go
        Higher powers taking a hold on me</p>
